# core

- [x] abstract all storage behind a Trait with sqlite in mind
- [x] move storage to sqlite for cli
- [x] ensure there is no (type, name) duplicate
- [x] extend sqlite functional tests
- [ ] block options
- [ ] if/end block
- [ ] while block

## api

- [x] sqlite locally behind Trait
- [x] API implementation
  - [x] run create (run object is written to DB at creation)
  - [x] run status (updated in DB as we make progress)
  - [x] incremental run ceation in DB
  - [x] APIState pointers to runs in progress
- [x] Postgres Store

## cli

- [x] split off cli code from core
      not fully splitted but well abstacted now (no filesystem in core code)
- [x] take type on top of name for inspect
- [ ] dust deploy (serve as an endpoint and log)
    - what is the underlying data store? run-like?
    - dust deploys list

# front

- [x] Landing
- [x] Github Login
- [x] Design + Run
- [ ] Deploy

# Go LIvE

## P0

- [x] block output display
- [x] work on the landing
- [x] integrate cohere in dust/core
- [x] allow read-only/unsigned access of public apps
- [x] sign-in in App top-bar when unsigned
- [x] better loading of blocks (loading message on runRequest)
- [x] rename root -> input
- [x] support menu:
  - [x] minimal documentation (README)
  - [x] discord invite
- [x] move to postgres
- [x] prod Github app with icon
- [x] minimal deployment on gcp
- [x] fix #11 #17 #18
- [x] fix map reduce
- [x] twitter card
- [x] initial demo 1 (math to code)

# Rapid follow-up

## P0

- [x] google analytics
- [x] search block
- [x] alert on dataset not saved
- [x] run/block button at the bottom
- [x] app description
- [x] settings pane (no delete)
- [ ] fork app
- [x] replit block (to cover curl, headless browser, advanced code)
- [ ] demo 2: web search assistant
- [ ] pre-fill new app + community examples in app view
  - [ ] blocked on fork
  - [x] prepare template app: https://dust.tt/spolu/a/768845d004
  - [ ] show community apps in app pane
- [ ] deploy as an endpoint + capture production executions
      this may require ability to view old versions
- [ ] while block
- [ ] if/then block
- [ ] demo 3: self-ask / react
- [ ] delete app

## P1
