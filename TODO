# core

- [x] abstract all storage behind a Trait with sqlite in mind
- [x] move storage to sqlite for cli
- [x] ensure there is no (type, name) duplicate
- [x] extend sqlite functional tests
- [ ] options block
- [ ] if/end block
- [ ] while block
- [ ] eval block
- [ ] interrupt only affected inputs on error

## api

- [x] sqlite locally behind Trait
- [x] API implementation

## cli

- [x] split off cli code from core
      not fully splitted but well abstacted now (no filesystem in core code)
- [x] take type on top of name for inspect

    - what is the underlying data store? run-like?
    - dust deploys list

# front
